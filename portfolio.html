    <div class="aboutIntro ">
        I am a recent graduate of the University of Massachusetts Boston. Currently I'm a student at Per Scholas
        pursuing an entry level position in software engineering. I'm a person who is curious and loves to learn.
        One of my best traits is to be resourceful, so that way I can get things done without having to procrastinate.

        <h3>Athletic Training Intern</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="aboutIntro ">
        During my last semester as a senior in college I did my internship over at Boston College High School. While I
        was there I participated in numerous Varsity games, overseeing injury and injury prevention. My favorite skill
        that I learned was the torn ACL test, however I can not perform it on anoyone without an actual license due to
        legal issues.

        <h3>Reign Total Body Fuel</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="aboutIntro ">
        Working for Reign Total Body Fuel was one of the most exciting jobs that I've ever had. From driving a pick up
        truck to getting free samples after every shift, every good thing must come to an end. During this job I was a
        brand ambassador meaning that I traveled to numerous amounts of events a month to promote products. My favorite
        thing about this job was that I over came my fear of talking to strangers, this job improved my communications
        skills and public speaking.

    <div class="aboutIntro ">
        One of my earlier jobs was workign at Uniqlo. This work enviorment taught me how to be organized in a way that I
        still fold my clothes a certain way, and color code all my clothing till this day. From this job I learned that
        to make a wall of clothes look good, all the little folds count, and I take this idea with everything that I do
        in life.
